 But when I am coding I look like this...â¤µ


 ## A little bit about me
My background is in Chemistry but I have worked in lots and lots of different jobs/industries. 

<p>
ðŸŒ± I love learning new things, whether its a new React Hook (that you will probably only ever need once), bouldering (my knees dont love this one so much) or making great coffee, I am always doing my best to be better! </br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently working on developing with new languages (C, Ruby, Python), smashing codewars and building fun real world products</br>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m really interested in learning more about design and creative coding!</br>
ðŸ’¬ Reach out if you want to collaborate on anything: </br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I can speak Arabic</p>
